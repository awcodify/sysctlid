Monitoring and observability are crucial aspects of managing modern systems. The "Four Golden Signals" is a framework that helps in understanding the performance and health of a system based on four key metrics: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. This Confluence page provides an overview of these signals and their significance in monitoring system performance.

## 1. Latency
Latency is the time taken for a system to respond to a request. Monitoring latency helps in assessing the responsiveness and efficiency of the system. Key points to consider when monitoring latency are:
* Track latency metrics such as average latency, percentiles (e.g., 95th or 99th percentile), and maximum latency.
* Identify any spikes or anomalies in latency that may indicate performance issues.
* Set appropriate latency thresholds and create alerts to proactively address potential problems.

## 2. Traffic
Traffic refers to the volume of requests or transactions processed by a system. Monitoring traffic helps in understanding the load and demand on the system. Key points to consider when monitoring traffic are:
* Monitor request rates or transaction counts over time.
* Identify peak traffic periods and ensure the system can handle the load efficiently.
* Detect any sudden increases or decreases in traffic that may require attention.

## 3. Errors
Errors indicate the number or rate of failed or erroneous requests in a system. Monitoring errors helps in identifying issues and ensuring system reliability. Key points to consider when monitoring errors are:
* Track error rates, such as the percentage of failed requests or transactions.
* Identify specific error types or error codes to focus on.
* Set alerts for high error rates or specific error patterns to promptly address issues.

## 4. Saturation
Saturation refers to the utilization or capacity of system resources. Monitoring saturation helps in understanding resource bottlenecks and potential performance limitations. Key points to consider when monitoring saturation are:
* Monitor resource utilization metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, or disk I/O.
* Identify any resources operating at or near maximum capacity.
* Set alerts for critical resource saturation levels to prevent system degradation or failures.

## Conclusion
The Four Golden Signals provide a framework for monitoring and assessing the performance and health of a system. By focusing on latency, traffic, errors, and saturation, you can gain valuable insights into your system's behavior and address potential issues proactively. Implementing appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms based on these signals can help ensure the reliability and optimal performance of your systems.
