If you haven't yet read [Part 1 - Introduction](/effortless-monitoring/1/introducing-kube-prometheus/), we recommend doing so before proceeding with this setup guide. 

## Setup Kube-Prometheus

In this article, we will guide you through the process of setting up Kube-Prometheus, a comprehensive monitoring solution tailored for Kubernetes environments. By the end of this guide, you'll have Kube-Prometheus up and running in your Kubernetes cluster, ready to provide insights into your applications and infrastructure.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the kube-prometheus repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git
```

### Step 2: Apply Configurations
```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -f manifests/setup
kubectl wait \
	--for condition=Established \
	--all CustomResourceDefinition \
	--namespace=monitoring
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

### Step 3 - Accessing the Services
To access the monitoring dashboards and interfaces, you can use port forwarding:

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/grafana <local-port>:<svc-port>
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-k8s <local-port>:<svc-port>
# Add more port-forward commands for other components as needed
```
Replace `<local-port>` with a port on your local machine and <svc-port> with the respective service ports.

## Customizing Kube-Prometheus

For a comprehensive guide on customizing Kube-Prometheus, you can head over to the official [customizing documentation](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/main/docs/customizing.md). This guide offers detailed insights into how you can modify and configure various aspects of Kube-Prometheus to suit your requirements.

Whether you need to adjust alerting rules, scraping intervals, or other settings, the customizing guide will walk you through the process step by step. Your monitoring setup can be as unique as your Kubernetes environment, ensuring you gather the most relevant and actionable insights.
